# pc-raiding-verification
Bot for verification of players and creation/management of raids for Pest Control. Functional for any RotMG Raiding Discord Server. This bot manages raids and verification within a Raiding Discord Server for RotMG.  This code is provided AS-IS with no guidence on compilation, setup or post-installation support. You are ON YOUR OWN when you use this, so familiarity with Java is strongly advised.

Built for JVM (Java 8) on Ubuntu 20.04, openjdk8-jre. Depends on nothing. There is a config file that is arcane and impossible to understand, and is harddesigned to work for PC only.  It is not impossible to decypher, but I can be reached to explain the file on discord @ aimee#4725 if I am available and willing.
